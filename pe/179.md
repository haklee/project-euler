# explanation

First, factorize all the integers from 1 to 10^7 by following method:

- Starting from 2, find all the integers divisible by prime i and set it's divisible by i^k.
- Do the same thing for next prime, until the prime gets bigger than 10^7.

Then, since all the intergers are now factorized, we can easily calculate the number of divisiors.
