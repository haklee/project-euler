# explanation

Simple brute force problem! The target number should be less than 1e6(which means, maximum 6 digit numbers), since

- There's no 7 digit number which satisfy the condition, because `1e6 = 10 * 10^5 > 7 * 9^5`.
- There's no 8 digit number which satisfy the condition, because `1e7 = 100 * 10^5 > 8 * 9^5`.
...
- There's no n digit number which satisfy the condition, because `10^n = 10^(n-5) * 10^5 > n * 9^5`.
