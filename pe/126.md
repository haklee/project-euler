## Number of cells in cuboid layer

By observation, we can see that number of cells in cuboid layer with given width(w), depth(d) and height(h) can be found:

- First layer: `2*(w*d + d*h + h*w)`
- Next layer: `Previous layer` + `4*(w + d + h)`
- Next layer: `Previous layer` + `4*(w + d + h)` + 8
- Next layer: `Previous layer` + `4*(w + d + h)` + 16
- Next layer: `Previous layer` + `4*(w + d + h)` + 24
- ...

With proirity queue Q, and cuboid item represented as (cell_cnt, width, depth, height, layer_num),

- Initialize
    - Add first layer of `1*1*1` cuboid, (6, 1, 1, 1, 1) to the Q.
- Process:
    - Get the minimum cell item in the Q (lowest value of `item[0]`), and remove it from the Q.
    - Calculate next layer cell count, and if it does not exceed the limit, add it to the Q.
    - with new candidiates [(w+1, d, h), (w, d+1, h), (w, d, h+1)],
        - If (new width, new depth, new height) cuboid was not processed,
        - And if (new width >= new depth >= new height),
        - And the cell count of the first layer of cuboid does not excced limit,
        - Add it the the queue.

Answer can be found by guessing limit value.
