# explanation

- First, find all 4 digit primes.
- Then, group primes which can be permutated to each other. Let's call such groups permutation sets.
- For each permutation set, get all the diffs of two primes in set. Leave only sets where same diff appears at least twice.
    - In such permutation set,
        - (p - d, p, p + d) could be found, which is the solution we are trying to find.
        - or, (p1, p1 + d, p2, p2 + d) could be found.
- For each permutation set we found in previous step, check if (p - d, p, p + d) are in the set by brute forcing.
