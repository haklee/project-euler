# explanation

I used line-line intersection formula explained in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection).

Some notes:

- Formula explained in wiki page only works for non-collinear case: but since the problem asks us to find 'true point of intersection', we can use thankfully the formula to solve the problem.
- If we calculate the intersection points, decimal precision problem arises. We need to find a way to save an intersection point value without directly going through division operations.
