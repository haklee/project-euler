# explanation

First, by solving `d((n/x)^x)/dx = 0`, which turns out to be `n/e`, we can find the x which maximizes `(n/x)^x`. So, integer value v which maximizes `(n/v)^v` is either `ceil(n/e)` or `floor(n/e)`.

Then, y comparing `(n/v_ceil)^v_ceil` and `(n/v_floor)^v_floor`, find the integer value x which maximizes `(n/x)^x`. Since both values can be large, compare logged values.

With `n/x` found by previous steps, check if it is terminating decimal or not by dividing x by gcd(n,x), 2's and 5's and if the value is 1.
