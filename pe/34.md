# explanation

Digit factorial sum for 8 digit number is less than 10^7(since `8 * 9! = 8 * 362880 < 10 * 10^6`), but all 8 digit numbers are larger than or equal to 10^7. Same holds for all the numbers with 9, 10, ... digits, so we only need to check the numbers less than 10^7 if digit facorial sum is equal to the number.
