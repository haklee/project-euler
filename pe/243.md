The problem is asking us to find n where `phi(n)/(n-1)` gets under the given ratio value.

- To make the value low, n should be mass production of small primes.
    - If 2 is not a prime factor of n, then when we multiply n by 2, phi(n) value is multiplied by (2-1), so `phi(n)/(n-1)` nearly halves down.
    - If 3 is not a prime factor of n, then when we multiply n by 3, new `phi(n)/(n-1)` is around 2/3 * (old `phi(n)/(n-1)`).
    - ...
- By brute forcing, `2 * 3 * 5 * ... * 23 * 29` gets below the given ratio. But unfortunately, it was not the answer.
- Then, we need to find a value i where `phi((2 * 3 * 5 * ... * 23)) * i / ((2 * 3 * 5 * ... * 23) * i - 1)` where i is less than 29.
    - Since all primes under 29 are multiplied in `2 * 3 * 5 * ... * 23`, for any integer i, `phi((2 * 3 * 5 * ... * 23) * i) = phi(2 * 3 * 5 * ... * 23) * i` holds.
