If 2^x is in form of 123abcdef..., then,

```txt
log(2^x) = log(123abcdef...) = log(123.abcdef... * 10^y)
<=> x * log(2) = log(10^y) + log(123.abcdef...) = y * log(10) + log(123.abcdef...)
```

so,

```txt
y * log(10) + log(123) <= x * log(2) < y * log(10) + log(124)
<=> (y * log(10) + log(123)) / log(2) <= x < (y * log(10) + log(124)) / log(2)
```

We just need to find all the x's which holds the condition while incrementing y.
