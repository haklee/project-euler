# explanation

- route from 6 to 1 (diff: 5 = 0b101)
    - 6 --(-2^0)--> 5 --(-2^2)--> 1
- route from 6 to 3 (diff: 3 = 0b11)
    - 6 --(-2^0)--> 5 --(-2^1)--> 3
- route from 6 to 2 (diff: 4 = 0b100)
    - 6 --(-2^2)--> 2

By observation, if we are finding route from `a` to `b`, then

- Find diff in binary. Let's call this `diff_bin`.
- Startring from the last digit of `diff_bin`,
    - If digit is 1, then add `a-(binary value till that digit)` to the solution.

(Need proof!)
