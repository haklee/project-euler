# explanation

- Sum of all digits of numbers in each family should not be divisible by 3:
    - If there are k wildcards:
        - If k == 1 (mod 3), then sums of wildcard numbers are [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0] mod 3.
            - If sum of other numbers equals 0 mod 3, you have to pick wildcard number with sum not equal to 0, but there are only 6 such number in wildcard sums [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0].
            - If sum of other numbers equals 1 mod 3, you have to pick wildcard number with sum not equal to 2, but there are only 7 such number.
            - If sum of other numbers equals 2 mod 3, you have to pick wildcard number with sum not equal to 1, but there are only 7 such number.
            - So k != 1 (mod 3).
        - If k == 2 (mod 3), then sums of wildcard numbers are [2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2] mod 3.
            - Similar to k == 1 case, you can't pick 8 wildcard numbers which all of them are not divisible by 3.
        - So, k == 3 (mod 3).
- Starting with k = 3 case, create wildcard patterns with 5, 6 digit numbers and brute force.

It was lucky to find the answer with k = 3 and 6-digit numbers.
