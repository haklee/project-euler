# explanation

Simple DP memoization problem! Following recurrence relation hold if we count all-grey tile case.

- Red(i) = Red(i-1) + Red(i-2), where Red(0) = 1 and Red(1) = 1
- Green(i) = Green(i-1) + Green(i-3), where Green(0) = 1, Green(1) = 1 and Green(2) = 1
- Blue(i) = Blue(i-1) + Blue(i-4), where Blue(0) = 1, Blue(1) = 1, Blue(2) = 1 and Blue(3) = 1

We need to eliminate all-grey tile cases at the end.
