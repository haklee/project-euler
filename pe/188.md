# explanation

Since 1777 is prime, by Euler's theorem,

```txt
1777↑↑1855 % 100000000
= 1777 ^ ((1777↑↑1854) % phi(100000000))
= 1777 ^ ((1777 ^ ((1777↑↑1853) % phi(phi(100000000)))) % phi(100000000))
...
```

phi(...(phi(100000000))) will eventually be 1, so we can calculate the value by recursion.
