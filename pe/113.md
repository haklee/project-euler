# explanation

- Increasing:
    - Pick from (0, 1, ..., 9), and sort.
        - n_H_10
    - Only positive number: eliminate 0.

So, n_H_10

- Decreasing:
    - Pick from (0, 1, ..., 9, x), and sort('x' means leading zero!).
        - n_H_11
    - But, 0...0, x0...0, xx0...0, xx...x00, xx...x0, xx...x cases are duplicate.
    - There are n+1 cases of zero, and since 0 is not positive, eliminate all.

So, n_H_11 - (n + 1)

- Duplicate case:
    - 1, 11, 111, ...
    - 2, 22, 222, ...
    - ...
    - 9, 99, 999, ...

There are n*9 cases.
