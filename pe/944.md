# explanation

For given natural number i < n, i is elevisor if any of multiples of i is in the set:

- Element i is fixed
- Number of multiples of i except i is n//i - 1
- Number of elements which is not multiples of i is n-(n//i)

So, in S(n), i is added `(2^(n//i - 1) - 1) * 2^(n-(n//i))` = `2^(n-1) - 2^(n-(n//i))` times.

If we sum up all the `i` * `2^(n-1) - 2^(n-(n//i))`,

- First part, `i * 2^(n-1)` turns into `(n * (n+1) / 2) * 2^(n-1)`.
- Second part, we need some observation.

for n = 10,

```txt
1 * 2^(10-10) --- 10

2 * 2^(10-5) --- 5

3 * 2^(10-3) --- 3
--------------------------- sqrt(10)
4 * 2^(10-2) --- 2
5 * 2^(10-2) --- 2

6 * 2^(10-1) --- 1
...
10 * 2^(10-1) --- 1
```

By observation, we can see that

- For i's larger than sqrt(n), there are multiple cases of same `2^(n-(n//i))`.
- For i's less than sqrt(n), there are only one case of `2^(n-(n//i))`.

So we can loop through 1 to int(sqrt(n)) to get the sum of those two cases.
