# explanation

If a given natural number _n_ is multiples of 3 or 5, `n % 3 == 0`, or `n % 5 == 0`.

If any of those equation holds, `(n % 3) * (n % 5) == 0` will also hold, so the solution can be calculated by summing up all the integers from 0 to 1000(the solution is still valid even if we include 0, because it's _summing_) which passes the condition `(n % 3) * (n % 5) == 0`.
