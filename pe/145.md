WIP: need proof!

Found answer by finding patterns:

- There are
    - 0 1-digit reversible numbers.
    - 20 2-digit reversible numbers.
    - 100 3-digit reversible numbers.
    - 600 4-digit reversible numbers.
    - 0 5-digit reversible numbers.
    - 18000 6-digit reversible numbers.
    - 50000 7-digit reversible numbers.
- Then, maybe...
    - 18000 * 30 8-digit reversible numbers.
    - 0 9-digit reversible numbers.

By summing up the numbers, I got the answer.
