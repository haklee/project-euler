# explanation

First, find candidates of last six digits by following process.

- Find distinct three digits, which can be divided by 17 when concatenated.
- Find distinct three digits, which can be divided by 13 when concatenated and last two digit appears in first two digits of any of item found in former process.
- Repeat the process with 11 and 7, and create candidates by concatenating six digits.
- Then, filter the candidates by checking if all six digits are distinct.

Then, for each item in candidate list, iterating through all permutations of unused numbers, concat the permutation and create pandigital number, and check if the pandigital number meets the first three conditions(divisible by 2, 3, 5).
