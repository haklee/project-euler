# explanation

This problem is easier to solve by hand than writing code to solve the problem in generalized form.

- Primes below 20: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
- We need:
    - 2 appears 4 times in 16.
    - 3 appears 2 times in 9.
    - 5 appears 1 time in 5.
    - 7 appears 1 time in 7.
    - ...
    - 19 appears 1 time in 19.
- solution: `2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19`
